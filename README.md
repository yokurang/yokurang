# yokurang

Hi, my name is Alan Matthew and I am a student studying math, computer science, and economics at college in Singapore. I have experience programming in Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, OCaml, Rust, Scala, and Kotlin. I like doing stuff in formal verification and some parallel programming here and there. 

One project I am working on right now is an OCaml ppx to transform OCaml code to Lua. This way, we'll be able to write NeoVim configs in OCaml. It is still a private project for now until I make enough progress to make it public.

In the meantime, perhaps my github stats might interest you,
